  Cars in Japan drive on the left; as a result, many pedestrians walk on the left - often unconsciously. So, when walking through the busy streets of Japan, you are likely to bump into less people if you keep to the left Jingu-dori, the street that passes right in front of the Hachiko Exit of Shibuya Station, is where you'll find the world-famous Shibuya Crossing.

  <p>The Japanese flag is made up of a red circle, symbolizing the sun, against a white background. It is known as the hinomaru in Japanese, meaning "circle of the sun." Because Japan lies at the far West of the Pacific Ocean, the sun rises spectacularly over the sea to the East. </p>
  <h2> This is Japanese food</h2>
